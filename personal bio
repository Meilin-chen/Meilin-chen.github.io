I am Meilin Chen. I am ready to graduating from University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign. I am majoring in Statistics and Economics. Since I am graduating from the university in May, the most urgent thing for me is to find a job.  I am not only interetsed in field related to Statistics or Economics. I am looking for any field I can support within my ability.
